This is the latest version of the Early Warning System (EWS), now built with Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and Express.js for enhanced performance and a modern design. EWS monitors temperature, humidity, and fire anomalies in server rooms, automatically sending notifications when abnormal conditions are detected. It utilizes Vue.js and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and Supabase as the database. The hardware includes an ESP8266 (NodeMCU), DHT11, and a fire detection sensor, with notifications managed via Node-RED and email alerts. The previous version of this project can be found in the following repository:
